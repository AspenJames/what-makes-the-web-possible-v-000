# What makes the web possible
To make the web work we need:

1. a common language (HTML)
2. a way to serve content (Web servers)
3. a way to view content (Web browsers)
4. servers and browsers should have an agreed-upon way of exchanging data (HTTP)
5. a way to send HTTP request to any computer connected to a network (The Internet)

Let's start with the last item. If we had all the other components, but we did not have a way to for browsers to send HTTP request to severs the web would not work. The web stands on the shoulders of a giant. That giant is the Internet. **The web is an Internet application, the same way that email is an Internet application**.

**Add other other examples to distinguish between the intenret and the web**

Now that we have a way to exchange HTTP request (web request) what are the other components for?

Let start with HTML. It's the language of the web. It's how we express information. Every website ever created is expressed using HTML. If we want to publish anything on the web, it will at some point be contained inside of an HTML document.

Once we have an HTML document we want to publish where do we place it to make it available to billions of internet users? Web servers make our content available to everyone on the internet. Web servers are our content publishers (from a technical point of view).

Our content is now available to the whole web. Yay! What tool can we use to view it? How do we reach it? This is where web browsers come in. Web browsers know how to translate HTML code into something that is pleasant to read for a human.

How do web browsers and servers interact? The relay on the internet to connect to each other. How can they exchange information in such a way that any browser (Mozilla, Edge, Chrome, and many others) can speak to any server? We need an agreed-upon convention for servers and browsers to exchange data. That convention (standard) is HTTP, and in networking parlance, it's a network protocol. It's how web browsers speak to web servers.

At its core, these five components make the internet possible. To recap:

1. The internet allows browsers and servers to connect to each other
2. Browsers and server interact with an agreed upon protocol. HTTP.
3. Content is represented as HTML documents
4. HTML documents are published by web servers
5. HTML documents are viewed using web browsers

The web and the internet are two marvelous pieces of engineering work, but that is not the reason why itâ€™s hard to imagine our life without them today. Their inventors made them free for anyone to use. Creators were able to build on top of the web and internet and reach anyone. This is what makes the web and internet magical.

How can you be one of those creators? Simply know how to  HTML. That's all you need to do! This is why knowing HTML is important.
